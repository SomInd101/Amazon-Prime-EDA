This data set was created to list all shows available on Amazon Prime streaming, and analyze the data to find interesting facts. This dataset has data available in the United States.

This dataset has only one file containing the titles, content name, content type, genres, release countries, production or release year in titles.csv.

By examining this dataset, the project aims to answer critical business questions such as: Which genres dominate Amazon Prime's library? How does content distribution vary across regions? How has the platform's content offering changed over time? And what are the highest-rated or most popular shows?

**The primary goal** of this analysis is to derive actionable insights into Amazon Primeâ€™s content strategy and evolution. 

***The project explores four key areas:***

**Content Diversity:** *Analyzing the variety of genres available, identifying the most and least represented categories, and understanding the balance between movies and series.*

**Regional Availability:** *Studying how content is distributed across different countries to highlight localization strategies and regional preferences.*

**Trends Over Time:** *Evaluating the growth and changes in Amazon Prime's content library over the years, identifying peak production periods, and spotting patterns in genre popularity.*

**IMDb Ratings & Popularity:** *Investigating which shows or movies have the highest viewer ratings and how popularity correlates with genres or release periods.*

Through visualizations, data summaries, and trend analysis, this project provides meaningful insights into viewer behavior, content acquisition patterns, and streaming industry benchmarks. These insights are particularly valuable for businesses, content creators, and data analysts in the media and entertainment industry. 

It serves as a strategic tool for content creators, media analysts, and streaming service providers who aim to optimize content portfolios, attract diverse audiences, and drive subscriber engagement.
